About

I design and develop analytics solutions that improve operational visibility, reduce inefficiencies, and support data-driven decision-making. My work combines data engineering practices, business operations experience, and production-quality Python development.

I have supported environments such as Roku, Samsung, CX operations, and healthcare logistics.
